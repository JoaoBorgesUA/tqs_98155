a) The technical debt was of 33 minutes, which means there is an implied cost of additional rework because of choosing to do an easy way solution and not a better permanent approach that will take more time, this permanent approach takes approximately 33 minutes.

The project did not have any major code smells...

(NOTE exercise c: for some reason, the jacoco plugin would crash my visual studio code, i tried to fix but there were no major solutions for this problem, probably java re installation? )![image-20220424122859772](/home/borges/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20220424122859772.png)

We can see that our IES project has some code smells and also some vulnerabilities, but still passes the quality gates

For purpose of testing:
